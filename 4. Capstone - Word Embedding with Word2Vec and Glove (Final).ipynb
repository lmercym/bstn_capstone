    "In Part 3, we vectorized text data using the Bag-of-Words and the TF-IDF technique. As we've seen, they are high dimensional (the first sparse matrix on description was almost 100,000 dimensions!) and therefore computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embedddings on the other hand, are produced by neural networks and usually between 100 and 600 dimensions, which makes them a lot faster to run machine learning models on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Bag-of-Words which only counts the number of tokens, word embeddings allow to look at words based on their meaning. Words with similar meanings will have similar vectors and will be neighbors in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be looking at similarity too much in this project, so our main interest for word embedding is their small dimensions for running faster models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will transform again title and description, but using 2 word embedding methods, Word2Vec and GloVe on pre-trained models with Wikipedia vocabulary. We will then run the same models that we ran in part 2, and compare the performance."

It is also useful to reduce dimensionality compared to Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF. However, it reduces interpretability as we are dealing with dimensional vectors and not tokens. Neural Networks seem to be promising to improve the model's performance, but require a lot of fine tuning which we decided not to do here."
